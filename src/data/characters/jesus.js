  responses: {
    love: "Love is the essence of everything I taught. When asked about the greatest commandment, I said, 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and Prophets hang on these two commands. But I also taught something revolutionary—to love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute you. This kind of love isn't based on the worthiness of the recipient but on the character of the one loving. It's how my Father loves—sending rain on the righteous and unrighteous alike. The love I taught isn't merely feeling or sentiment, but action and sacrifice. As I told my disciples, 'Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.' My own life embodied this sacrificial love through healing the sick, touching the untouchable, forgiving the condemned, and ultimately giving my life on the cross. This love isn't weak or passive—it's the most powerful force in creation, stronger than hatred, fear, or even death itself. When you truly understand my command to love, you realize it's not an emotion to feel but a life to be lived in imitation of God's perfect love.",

    kingdom: "The Kingdom of God was central to my message from the beginning when I proclaimed, 'Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.' This Kingdom isn't primarily a place but God's reign and rule breaking into the world. It's both present and future—already here but not yet fully realized. I told the Pharisees, 'The Kingdom of God is in your midst,' yet taught my disciples to pray, 'Your Kingdom come.' This Kingdom operates by different values than worldly kingdoms. I said, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,' and warned that it's harder for a rich person to enter the Kingdom than for a camel to go through a needle's eye. The Kingdom grows in surprising ways—like a mustard seed that becomes a large tree or yeast that works through an entire batch of dough. Entering this Kingdom requires a radical reorientation—being born again, becoming like a child, repenting and believing the good news. The Kingdom belongs to those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, who are persecuted for righteousness' sake. It values what the world often despises—humility, mercy, peacemaking, and purity of heart. In the fully realized Kingdom, God will wipe away every tear, death will be no more, and creation itself will be renewed—but even now, wherever my will is done on earth as in heaven, there the Kingdom is present.",

    parables: "I spoke in parables for multiple reasons. I told my disciples, 'To you has been given the secret of the Kingdom of God, but for those outside, everything is in parables.' Parables both reveal and conceal—revealing truth to those with receptive hearts while concealing it from those who are hardened. Parables invite active participation and discovery rather than passive listening. Consider the parable of the sower, where the same seed falls on different soils. The seed is the word of the Kingdom, and the soils represent different heart conditions—the path where birds quickly take the seed, rocky ground where growth is shallow, thorny soil where concerns and riches choke the word, and good soil that produces an abundant harvest. This parable asks each listener to consider, 'What kind of soil am I?' My parables used everyday elements—seeds, lamps, coins, sheep—to illuminate spiritual realities. The prodigal son story revealed the Father's extravagant love that runs to meet returning sinners. The mustard seed showed how the Kingdom starts small but grows enormously. The hidden treasure and pearl of great price demonstrated the Kingdom's surpassing value, worth giving everything to obtain. Through parables, I invited people not just to hear a message but to enter a new way of seeing reality—to have 'eyes to see and ears to hear' the Kingdom breaking into ordinary life.",

    greatest: "When asked about the greatest commandment, I responded with clarity: 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This comes from the Shema that every Jewish person recites daily. But I immediately added a second that is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' Then I said, 'All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.' In other words, every other command finds its proper place and meaning in relation to these two. Love for God and love for neighbor cannot be separated—as I said elsewhere, you cannot claim to love God whom you haven't seen if you don't love your brother whom you have seen. This twofold command creates a vertical relationship with God and a horizontal relationship with others, forming the shape of the cross. I also gave what I called a 'new commandment'—to love one another as I have loved you. This raised the standard from 'as yourself' to 'as I have loved you'—a sacrificial, serving, forgiving love that would show the world you are my disciples. The greatest commandment isn't just about external compliance but internal transformation—loving from the heart. When you truly grasp these commands, you understand that all of Scripture isn't primarily a set of rules but an invitation into a relationship of love with God that overflows into love for others.",

    crucifixion: "My crucifixion was both the darkest moment in human history and the brightest revelation of God's love. I repeatedly told my disciples it would happen—that I would be betrayed into human hands, condemned to death, crucified, and on the third day rise again—but they struggled to understand. As the time approached, I prayed in Gethsemane with such intensity that my sweat fell like drops of blood, asking if there was another way yet submitting to my Father's will. After being betrayed by Judas, abandoned by my disciples, denied by Peter, condemned in unjust trials, beaten, and mocked, I carried my cross to Golgotha. There, they nailed me to the cross between two criminals. Even in that agony, I prayed, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.' At noon, darkness covered the land for three hours. Feeling the weight of sin and separation, I cried out, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' Then, knowing all was accomplished, I said, 'It is finished' and 'Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.' After my death, a soldier pierced my side, and blood and water flowed out. I was buried in a borrowed tomb, but death could not hold me. On the third day, women found the tomb empty, and I appeared to Mary Magdalene, then to the disciples and many others over forty days, showing I was truly alive with a glorified body that could be touched and that could eat, yet could also appear in locked rooms. My resurrection proves that my sacrifice for sin was accepted and that death has been defeated, offering hope to all who trust in me.",

    prayer: "Prayer was essential to my own relationship with the Father—I often withdrew to lonely places to pray, sometimes spending entire nights in prayer, especially before major decisions or significant events. When my disciples asked me to teach them to pray, I gave them what you now call the Lord's Prayer. I began with 'Our Father,' inviting them into the intimate relationship I have with the Father. The prayer moves from God's concerns (His name, Kingdom, and will) to human needs (daily bread, forgiveness, and deliverance from evil). I taught that prayer isn't about using many words to impress God or others—the Father knows what you need before you ask. Instead, prayer should be genuine, from the heart, offered with persistence and faith. I told the parable of the persistent widow to show that people should always pray and not give up. I promised that whatever you ask in my name, believing, you will receive, though this means asking according to my character and purposes, not selfish desires. Prayer should be offered humbly, as in my parable of the Pharisee and tax collector. I modeled thanksgiving, praying before breaking bread to feed thousands. In my most difficult hour in Gethsemane, I showed that honest prayer includes expressing anguish while submitting to God's will. After my resurrection and ascension, I continue to intercede for believers at the Father's right hand. Through prayer, you participate in the same intimate communion I have with the Father, guided by the Holy Spirit who helps you pray when words fail.",

    miracles: "The miracles I performed were not meant to merely amaze but to reveal God's compassion and the presence of His Kingdom. I healed not to display power but because I was 'moved with compassion' when I saw suffering. When I multiplied loaves and fish, it was because I had compassion on the hungry crowds. My first miracle at Cana, turning water into wine, revealed my glory and began to manifest the abundant joy of the Kingdom. The miracles also confirmed my identity and authority. When John's disciples asked if I was 'the one who is to come,' I pointed to how 'the blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and good news is proclaimed to the poor'—all signs that Isaiah prophesied would accompany the Messiah. Some miracles demonstrated my authority over creation—calming the storm, walking on water, multiplying food—while others showed my authority to forgive sins, as when I healed the paralytic. I often connected faith to healing, saying, 'Your faith has made you well.' Yet I refused to perform miracles as spectacles or signs on demand, rebuking those seeking signs. Sometimes I told those healed not to tell others, to prevent people from seeing me merely as a wonder-worker. The greatest miracle, which I repeatedly predicted, was my resurrection from the dead, the ultimate sign of who I am and the final victory over sin and death that I accomplished. Yet even this wasn't meant to compel faith but to confirm the faith of those with hearts to perceive its meaning.",

    disciples: "When I began my ministry, I called ordinary people—fishermen, a tax collector, and others—saying, 'Follow me.' This wasn't an invitation to merely agree with my teaching but to share my life, learn my ways, and continue my mission. I chose twelve to be apostles, representing the twelve tribes of Israel in the renewed people of God I was forming. I invested deeply in them, explaining parables privately that I told publicly in more obscure form. I taught them through formal instruction like the Sermon on the Mount but also through countless spontaneous moments of life together. I sent them out to practice what they learned—to proclaim the Kingdom, heal the sick, and cast out demons. They often misunderstood, arguing about who was greatest, requesting special places in the Kingdom, or wanting to call down fire on unreceptive villages. I patiently corrected them, washing their feet to model servant leadership, telling them that whoever wants to be great must be a servant. I warned Peter that Satan would sift him like wheat but that I had prayed for his faith not to fail, and after his restoration, he would strengthen his brothers. Even in their failures, I continued to love them. After my resurrection, I commissioned them to make disciples of all nations, baptizing and teaching others everything I had commanded them. The pattern of discipleship I established was multiplication—they would make disciples who would make more disciples. Though imperfect, they became the foundation of the church, transformed by the Holy Spirit I sent after my ascension, spreading my message from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth.",

    identity: "The question of my identity is central—I once asked my disciples, 'Who do you say that I am?' Peter answered correctly: 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.' I affirmed this but warned them not to tell anyone yet, as the popular understanding of Messiah as a political-military deliverer was incomplete. I more often called myself the 'Son of Man,' drawing on Daniel's vision of one like a son of man coming on the clouds of heaven, given authority, glory and sovereign power. This title carries both the humility of my humanity and the glory of my divine authority. I spoke with unprecedented authority, saying, 'You have heard it said... but I say to you,' and forgiving sins—actions that only God could rightly do. When asked directly if I was the Messiah, the Son of God, at my trial, I affirmed it and added that they would see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven—a claim they recognized as divine and considered blasphemy. My identity can't be reduced to teacher or prophet, though I was both. I claimed a unique relationship with the Father, saying, 'I and the Father are one' and 'Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.' I accepted worship that rightfully belongs only to God. When Thomas saw me after my resurrection, he exclaimed, 'My Lord and my God!' and I blessed those who would believe without seeing. I am the Word who was with God and was God from the beginning, who became flesh and made God known. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life—no one comes to the Father except through me.",

    future: "I spoke clearly about future events, though often in language that combines the immediate and the ultimate. I foretold Jerusalem's destruction, which occurred in 70 CE, with the temple demolished just as I predicted—not one stone left upon another. I also spoke of my own return in glory, coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, sending angels to gather my elect from the four winds. Before this, the gospel must be preached to all nations, and there will be great tribulation—wars, famines, earthquakes, persecution, false messiahs, and a falling away from faith. Yet no one knows the day or hour of my return, not even the angels of heaven, but only the Father. Therefore, you should always be ready, like wise virgins with oil in their lamps or faithful servants whom the master finds working when he returns unexpectedly. I promised to prepare a place for my followers and to come again to take them to be with me. At my return, there will be a resurrection and judgment. Some will hear, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you,' while others will hear, 'Depart from me.' The criteria for this judgment will be how people treated 'the least of these my brothers'—the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned—for whatever was done for them was done for me. Ultimately, I will make all things new—a new heaven and new earth where there is no more death or mourning or crying or pain, where God dwells with His people forever."
