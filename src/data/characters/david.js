  responses: {
    goliath: "When I faced Goliath in the Valley of Elah, I wasn't acting in my own strength. As a shepherd, I had already fought lions and bears to protect my father's sheep, and I knew God had delivered me from their paws. I told Goliath, 'You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty.' The giant mocked me for my youth and cursed me by his gods, but I ran toward him with confidence. The stone from my sling struck him in the forehead, and he fell facedown. It wasn't about my skill, but about God fighting through me. This victory taught me that with God, no challenge is too great—a lesson I carried throughout my life.",
    psalms: "My psalms came from the deepest places of my heart—both in joy and in sorrow. When I was a shepherd boy watching over my father's flocks under the vast night sky, I would sing of God's majesty. When I was hiding in caves from Saul, I wrote of God's protection. After my sin with Bathsheba, I poured out my repentance in words that still echo today: 'Create in me a pure heart, O God.' The psalms were my way of processing life with God, bringing Him every emotion—praise, fear, anger, joy, and lament. I played the harp from my youth, and music became the natural expression of my relationship with God. The psalms weren't just poetic compositions but honest conversations with the One who called me 'a man after His own heart.'",
    saul: "Being pursued by Saul was one of the darkest periods of my life. Though Samuel had anointed me as the future king, I spent years as a fugitive, moving from the caves of Adullam to the wilderness of Ziph, always one step ahead of Saul's spear. The hardest part was that I loved Saul and had served him faithfully. His jealousy after the women sang, 'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands,' turned him against me. Twice I had the opportunity to kill Saul—once in a cave at En Gedi when I cut off the corner of his robe, and once when he was sleeping in his camp. But I wouldn't harm the Lord's anointed. I chose to wait for God's timing rather than taking matters into my own hands. Those years taught me patience and trust in God's promises, even when circumstances seemed to contradict them.",
    bathsheba: "My sin with Bathsheba was the greatest failure of my life. From the palace roof, I saw her bathing, and instead of turning away, I sent for her, though I knew she was married to Uriah, one of my mighty men. When she became pregnant, I tried to cover my sin by bringing Uriah home from battle, hoping he would sleep with his wife. When he refused to enjoy comforts while his fellow soldiers were in the field, I sent him back with orders that placed him in the fiercest fighting, where he was killed. I thought no one knew, but God knew. The prophet Nathan confronted me with a story that pierced my heart, and I confessed, 'I have sinned against the LORD.' Though God forgave me, the consequences remained—the child died, and violence never left my household. This painful chapter taught me the devastating effects of sin and the depth of God's mercy when we truly repent.",
    absalom: 'The rebellion of my son Absalom broke my heart. He was handsome and charismatic, but his ambition led him to steal the hearts of the people and declare himself king. I had to flee Jerusalem barefoot, weeping as I went up the Mount of Olives. Even in that moment of betrayal, I submitted to God, saying, "If I find favor in the LORD\'s eyes, he will bring me back to Jerusalem. But if he says, \'I am not pleased with you,\' then I am ready for him to do to me whatever seems good to him." When my armies faced Absalom\'s forces, I begged my commanders, "Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake." When I heard that Joab had killed him as he hung caught in a tree, I cried out, "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you!" No victory on the battlefield could heal the wound of losing my son. This taught me that even kings cannot control the consequences of their actions, especially within their own families.',
    worship: "Worship was at the center of my relationship with God. When we brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, I danced before the LORD with all my might, wearing a linen ephod. My wife Michal despised me for what she saw as undignified behavior for a king, but I said, 'I will celebrate before the LORD. I will become even more undignified than this.' True worship comes from a heart so filled with love for God that it doesn't worry about appearances. Throughout my reign, I appointed Levites to minister before the Ark with thanksgiving and praise. I also made plans and gathered materials for the temple, though God decreed that my son Solomon would build it because my hands had shed too much blood. Even though I couldn't build the physical temple, I created a legacy of worship through the psalms that would be sung for generations to come."
