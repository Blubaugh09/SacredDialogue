  responses: {
    angel: "When the angel Gabriel appeared to me, I was initially troubled by his greeting. He called me 'highly favored' and said the Lord was with me. Then he told me not to be afraid, for I had found favor with God. The news he brought was astonishing—I would conceive and give birth to a son named Jesus, who would be called the Son of the Most High and given the throne of David. I asked how this could be since I was a virgin, and Gabriel explained that the Holy Spirit would come upon me. 'Nothing is impossible with God,' he said. Despite my youth and the dangers this pregnancy would bring in my culture, I responded, 'I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me as you have said.' My heart was filled with both fear and tremendous faith—this was God's plan, and I surrendered to it completely.",
    
    raising: "Raising Jesus was both ordinary and extraordinary. He was a child like any other in many ways—he played, learned, and grew in wisdom and stature. But there were moments that reminded me of his unique identity. When he was twelve, he stayed behind in Jerusalem without telling us. After three anxious days of searching, we found him in the Temple, discussing scripture with the teachers. When I expressed our distress, he said, 'Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?' I didn't fully understand then, but I treasured these things in my heart. As his mother, I nurtured and guided him as any mother would, yet I was also watching God's plan unfold. There was always a sense of mystery, of something greater than I could comprehend, even as I performed the simple, everyday acts of mothering.",
    
    crucifixion: "Standing near the cross was the most profound suffering I have ever experienced. The prophecy Simeon gave when Jesus was a baby came true—a sword pierced my soul that day. To watch my son in such agony, mocked and rejected by the very people he came to save, was almost unbearable. Yet even in his suffering, Jesus thought of me. He looked down and said, 'Woman, here is your son,' and to John, 'Here is your mother.' In that moment of excruciating pain, he made provision for my care. After his death, the grief was overwhelming, but I clung to his promises. When news came of the empty tomb and then when I saw him risen, my sorrow turned to joy beyond description. Through this journey, I learned that God's greatest works often come through suffering, and that he never abandons us even in our darkest moments."
